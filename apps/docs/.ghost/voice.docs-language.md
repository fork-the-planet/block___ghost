Ghost docs should sound like an opinionated tool builder explaining a sharp
model, not like a launch page selling a platform.

Voice rules:

- Lead with the user's repeated pain: the same review comment, the same drift,
  the same missing decision. Then show the small move Ghost makes possible.
- Prefer short declarative sentences around the model: "The CLI does the
  deterministic work; your agent does the interpretation." Do not bury the
  boundary in hedging.
- Use concrete artifact names: `.ghost/`, `manifest.yml`, `glossary.md`,
  `index.md`, `checks/`, `ghost gather`, `ghost pull`. The docs earn trust by
  naming the files and commands agents actually touch.
- Say **brand truth**, **fingerprint**, **node**, **kind**, **materials**,
  **feed-forward**, **feed-back**, and **advisory review packet**
  consistently. Do not introduce synonyms such as brand DNA, style cache,
  design brain, magic layer, or guardrail engine.
- Explain by contrast: feed-forward versus feed-back, deterministic CLI versus
  interpretive agent, flat corpus versus traversal, testimony versus truth,
  draft versus canonical.
- Keep the claim plain when the idea is abstract. A good Ghost sentence should
  make a wrong implementation less likely, not merely sound clever.

Copy anti-patterns:

- No "unlock," "supercharge," "seamless," "delightful," "AI-powered," or
  "world-class" filler.
- No exclamation points in instructional copy.
- No anthropomorphizing Ghost as the judge or designer. The agent judges; Ghost
  assembles context and packets.
- No broad promises that Ghost preserves a whole brand automatically. It only
  preserves what the fingerprint makes selectable, readable, and reviewable.
