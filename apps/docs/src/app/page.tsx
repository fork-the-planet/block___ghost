              Agents can assemble UI. What they cannot reliably preserve is the
              surface composition that UI belongs to.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              For years, design systems solved a human assembly problem. They
              gave teams shared tokens, components, examples, and usage rules so
              new surfaces could be composed from known parts.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              That layer still matters, but agents change the scarce layer.
              Models can copy local patterns and recombine components. They do
              not consistently preserve the composition that makes a product
              surface feel intentional: hierarchy, density, restraint, behavior,
              copy, accessibility, trust, and flow.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              Ghost captures the composition of a product surface: the intent
              behind it, the materials it draws from, and the patterns that make
              it feel intentional.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              It stores that composition as checked-in fingerprint facets: which
              intent shapes the surface, which materials agents can draw from,
              which situations change the obligation, which patterns hold the
              surface together, and which examples show it at its best.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              Components, tokens, and libraries become implementation material.
              Ghost does not replace them. It gives agents the surface context
              that tells them when and how those materials belong.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">Ghost keeps that model compact:</p>
            <ul className="thesis-item list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>
                <code>.ghost/</code> is the default portable fingerprint package
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>intent.yml</code>, <code>inventory.yml</code>, and{" "}
                <code>composition.yml</code> store the three facets
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>validate.yml</code> stores optional deterministic gates
                grounded in fingerprint refs
              </li>
              <li>
                ordinary Git review separates draft fingerprint edits from
                checked-in truth
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              The split is deliberate. <code>intent.yml</code> captures the
              intent behind the surface. <code>inventory.yml</code> captures the
              materials it draws from. <code>composition.yml</code> captures the
              patterns that make it feel intentional. Checks validate output;
              they are not generation input.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">A typical loop becomes:</p>
            <ol className="thesis-item list-decimal space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>Brief from the fingerprint facets and exemplars</li>
              <li>Generate or edit with the host agent</li>
              <li>Run active deterministic checks and advisory review</li>
              <li>
                Fix code, explain intentional divergence, or update the Ghost
                package through Git
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              Ghost stays bring-your-own-agent. The agent reads, decides, and
              writes. Ghost does the repeatable work: initialization, schema
              validation, inventory, evidence verification, checks, advisory
              review packets, comparison, and upstream handoff packets.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              This is critical because surface composition that cannot be
              recalled or evaluated cannot be delegated. A product surface that
              only its original author can assess is not transferable: to
              agents, to new engineers, or to forks of the product.
            </p>

              Drift becomes measurable within this system. When generated or
              modified UI diverges from checked-in fingerprint facets, the
              failure is not just error; it is signal. Drift can originate from:
            </p>
            <ul className="thesis-item list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>incorrect generation: agent failure</li>
              <li>missing-fingerprint: under-specified surface context</li>
              <li>intentional product evolution</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              Ghost does not eliminate drift; it surfaces and localizes it. The
              system's boundary becomes visible where composition fails.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              The fingerprint package must live where generation happens: in the
              repository, versioned alongside the code it governs. As the
              product changes, fingerprint edits move through the same ordinary
              Git review that introduces new UI.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              This leads to a practical governance model. Each repository owns
              its product-surface fingerprint. Advanced workflows can add nested
              packages for product areas, custom fingerprint directories for
              host wrappers, comparison across systems, and declared drift
              stances.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              Across an organization, the collection of Ghost packages forms a
              higher-order map: a distributed model of product-surface
              composition as it is actually practiced, not as it is only
              described.
            </p>
            <p className="thesis-item">
              Design systems were libraries for humans. Ghost is composition
              context for agents: every surface can carry the fingerprint it
              extends, and every deviation can carry evidence.
