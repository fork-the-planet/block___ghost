Let me think through the key factors:\n\n1. **Bundle size reduction** - Since server components don't ship JavaScript to the client, the initial bundle can be significantly smaller.\n\n2. **Data fetching** - Server components can fetch data directly during rendering, eliminating client-side waterfalls.\n\n3. **Streaming** - The server can stream HTML progressively, improving Time to First Byte.`}
