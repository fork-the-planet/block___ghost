"@design-intelligence/ghost": patch

Align docs and the skill bundle with the prose-bound check model: checks are no
longer routed by surface, every check is offered and the agent judges which
apply, and a check binds to prose via its optional `source:` pointer. Fix
the `ghost scan` next-step hint and skill recipes that referenced a nonexistent
`ghost check` command.
