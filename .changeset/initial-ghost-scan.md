Bootstrap `ghost-scan` — Ghost's fingerprint.md authoring package. CLI verbs: `lint`, `describe`, `diff` (new — structural prose-level diff), and `emit <kind>` (kinds: review-command, context-bundle, skill). The skill bundle ships the map-aware `fingerprint.md` recipe alongside the condensed schema reference. All four verbs are deterministic; fingerprint is a recipe the host agent executes. Mirrors the BYOA contract that the rest of Ghost follows.
