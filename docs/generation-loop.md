# Fingerprint Generation Loop

Ghost gives UI generators and product-development agents a local, auditable
product-surface composition fingerprint. Generation starts from checked-in
facets; checks and review govern the result afterward.

        v
deterministic gates + advisory surface-composition findings
```

## Before Generation

Build a brief from the resolved fingerprint stack:

```bash
ghost relay gather apps/checkout/review/page.tsx
```

Relay compiles selected context from the resolved stack as context hits:
fingerprint refs, why they matched, suggested reads, omissions, and gaps.

Use the brief in this order:

1. Start from the selected context hits and their match reasons.
2. Apply intent and composition hits before choosing implementation details.
3. Inspect inventory hits as concrete anchors.
4. Use `inventory.building_blocks` as curated material.
5. Run `ghost signals` when raw repo observations would help find evidence.
6. Skim active checks in `.ghost/validate.yml` so generation avoids
   deterministic failures.
7. Treat gaps as a signal to use local evidence provisionally or inspect the
   full facet files.

Raw repo signals can help orient an agent:

```bash
ghost signals .
```

Signals answer what exists now and do not count as fingerprint contribution.
`intent.yml` captures the intent behind the surface. Curated inventory points to
building blocks and exemplars. `composition.yml` captures the patterns that make
the surface feel intentional.

## Govern

`ghost check` is deterministic:

```bash
ghost check --base main --format json
```

Without `--package`, `ghost check` groups changed files by resolved fingerprint
stack and runs merged checks for each group. Only active checks can block.

`ghost review` is advisory:

```bash
ghost review --base main
```

Advisory review packets include the current diff, the same context-hit model as
Relay, active checks, and finding categories for fixes, intentional
divergence, missing fingerprint grounding, experience gaps, and eval
uncertainty.

Review findings should cite the diff location, relevant fingerprint facet refs,
relevant exemplars when useful, any active check when blocking, and a
selected-context gap or local-evidence rationale when the fingerprint is silent.

## Remediation

When review flags drift from the fingerprint, the host agent chooses the
smallest useful response:

- Fix the generated or changed code.
- Explain why a divergence is intentional.
- Update the split fingerprint package when the user asks to change the Ghost
  fingerprint.

## CI

CI should run deterministic checks for UI-touching changes. Advisory review can
attach a packet or comment, but it should not fail the build unless a finding is
backed by an active check.

```bash
ghost check --base main
ghost review --base main --format markdown
```

Advanced wrappers that store fingerprint packages outside `.ghost` can set
`GHOST_PACKAGE_DIR=<relative-dir>` on stack-aware commands. `--package <dir>`
remains exact single-bundle mode and bypasses stack discovery.

## Legacy Cache Helpers

Older Ghost bundles used `resources.yml`, `map.md`, `survey.json`,
`patterns.yml`, and direct `fingerprint.yml` files under `.ghost/` as capture
material. Those files are now legacy/cache source material. Promote durable
conclusions into `intent.yml`, `inventory.yml`, and `composition.yml`.
