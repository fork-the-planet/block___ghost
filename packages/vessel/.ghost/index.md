description: Start here — what the Vessel fingerprint covers and how to read it.
---

Vessel is Ghost's reference body: an agnostic, agent-safe shadcn-compatible
component registry that a product's own Ghost fingerprint can inhabit. This
fingerprint governs Vessel the workspace — its token contract, authoring
discipline, registry shape, and the boundary between reference vocabulary and
product brand truth.

Read `principle.reference-not-brand` first; it is the seam every other truth
respects. The `asset.tokens` node describes the token contract that component
work must preserve. The `condition.*` nodes fire in specific situations —
escape hatches and upstream shadcn syncs — and stay silent otherwise.

This fingerprint deliberately does not carry product stance, flows, copy, or
trust obligations. Consuming repos author those in their own `.ghost/`
packages. When a truth here seems to conflict with a consumer's fingerprint,
the consumer's fingerprint wins in the consumer's repo.
