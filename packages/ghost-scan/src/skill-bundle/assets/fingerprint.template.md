# Character

2-4 sentences on the personality of this design language. Describe the language directly instead of introducing the project by name. Name what the system permits, not only what it avoids: scale contrast, shaped composition, semantic color, role-based elevation, functional motion, font sourcing, or themeable tokens.

# Signature

2-4 sentences on the final-picture posture: dominant moves, layout habits, and what generated output should feel like when the language comes together.

# Decisions

### color-strategy

Prose rationale for the color-strategy decision. Implementation-agnostic: name the pattern, not the token.

**Evidence:**
- `--color-primary: #000000`
- Survey color evidence: dominant observations cluster on the neutral palette

### spatial-system

Prose rationale for the spatial-system decision.

**Evidence:**
- `--space-4: 16px`
- Survey spacing evidence: padding/gap/margin observations stay on the documented scale
