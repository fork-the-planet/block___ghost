# Character

2-4 sentences on the personality of this design language. This prose becomes `observation.summary` when parsed. Name what the system permits, not only what it avoids: scale contrast, shaped composition, semantic color, role-based elevation, functional motion, font sourcing, or themeable tokens.

# Decisions

### color-strategy

Prose rationale for the color-strategy decision. Implementation-agnostic: name the pattern, not the token.

**Evidence:**
- `--color-primary: #000000`

### spatial-system

Prose rationale for the spatial-system decision.

**Evidence:**
- `--space-4: 16px`
