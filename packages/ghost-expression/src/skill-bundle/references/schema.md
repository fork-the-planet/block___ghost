# expression.md schema reference

Canonical filename: `expression.md`.

Companion file: `embedding.md` (sibling fragment containing the 49-dim vector). The CLI writes it automatically when you write an `expression.md` via `ghost-drift`; you can also compute and append it yourself.

## Frontmatter (machine layer)

```yaml
---
# identity
id: my-project                  # required, slug-like
# (no schema version field — the format is unversioned for now)
source: llm                     # registry | extraction | llm | unknown
timestamp: 2026-04-20T00:00:00Z # ISO-8601
sources:                        # optional — targets that were combined
  - github:owner/repo
  - ./local/path

# narrative tags (prose lives in the body)
observation:
  personality: [restrained, editorial]   # 3-6 adjectives
  resembles: [linear, notion]       # 1-3 known references this resembles

# abstract design decisions — frontmatter carries the dimension slug only.
# Rationale prose AND `**Evidence:**` bullets live in the body under the
# matching `### <dimension>` block. The schema is `.strict()` and rejects
# `evidence:` (or any other field) here.
decisions:
  - dimension: color-strategy            # freeform slug
  - dimension: spatial-system
  - dimension: composition-patterns      # optional: response/output shapes

# promoted review rules — optional. Candidate rules stay outside the file
# until a human curator promotes them.

## Body (prose layer)

```markdown
# Character

2-4 sentences capturing the holistic personality of this design language. This is `observation.summary`.

# Decisions

### color-strategy

Prose rationale for the color-strategy decision. This is `decisions[i].decision` — the implementation-agnostic statement of the pattern. One `### <dimension>` block per entry in `decisions`, matched by dimension slug.

**Evidence:**
- `--color-primary: #0066cc`
- `src/theme.ts:12`

### spatial-system

Prose rationale for the spatial-system decision.

**Evidence:**
- `--space-4: 16px`

### composition-patterns

Prose rationale for how generated outputs should choose article, tracker, comparison, card, or control-surface shapes. Use this when the project has examples or docs that prove composition is part of the design language.

**Evidence:**
- `registry examples distinguish atom demos from shape demos`

# Fragments

- [embedding](embedding.md)
```

## The partition (the one rule)

Every field lives in exactly one layer:

| Field | Layer |
|---|---|
| `id`, `source`, `timestamp`, `sources` | Frontmatter |
| `observation.personality`, `observation.resembles` | Frontmatter |
| `observation.summary` | **Body** (`# Character`) |
| `decisions[].dimension` | Frontmatter |
| `decisions[].decision` (prose) | **Body** (`### <dimension>` block) |
| `decisions[].evidence` | **Body** (`**Evidence:**` bullets under `### <dimension>`) |
| `palette`, `spacing`, `typography`, `surfaces` | Frontmatter |
| `embedding` | Sibling `embedding.md` |

Putting prose into frontmatter is a schema error. The writer and reader both enforce this. When in doubt: structured data → frontmatter; narrative → body.

## Validation

    ghost-expression lint expression.md

This catches schema violations, missing required fields, prose-in-frontmatter, orphaned decision blocks (body `### dim` with no matching frontmatter entry, or vice versa), and uncited palette entries (info-level — palette colors not cited in any decision evidence/prose).

Canonical decision dimensions include `composition-patterns` for task-shaped output structure: article for plans/timelines/worksheets, tracker for metrics/progress/reviews, comparison for tradeoffs/options, and card for compact focused recommendations or repeated peer items. Card is one shape, not the default form of every generated answer.
