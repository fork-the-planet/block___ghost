/**
 * Ghost's perceptual prior — the opinionated stance that drift severity
 * should track *how loudly a change registers visually*, not just whether
 * it deviates from a recorded value.
 *
 * Three perceptual tiers:
 *
 *   - **loud**: visible at first glance, no inspection required. Color
 *     and typeface family are loud — a new color or font is the change
 *     everyone notices.
 *   - **structural**: visible on inspection or interaction. Radius
 *     philosophy (pill vs. boxy), elevation vocabulary, focus treatment.
 *     Pill among boxes screams; the wrong shadow on a flat system jars.
 *   - **rhythmic**: visible only as a system property. Spacing scale
 *     adherence, density, motion duration. Individual deviations are
 *     nearly imperceptible — the rhythm matters in aggregate.
 *
 * Two cross-cutting rules:
 *
 *   1. **Match shape** is per-`RuleKind`: color is `exact`, spacing is
 *      `band`, type-size is `percent`, radius/shadow are `structural`.
 *      Defaults are sensible; per-rule overrides remain available.
 *   2. **Presence/absence escalation**: when bucket count for a
 *      guarded phenomenon is ≤ `presence_floor`, escalate the rule one
 *      tier. Sparsity is the design decision — adding to a silent pattern
 *      is louder than tweaking a populated one.
 *
 * Tier membership is a position: projects can override per-rule severity
 * but cannot remap a dimension's tier. The tiers are the product.

 *     size-detail drift is rhythmic (handled by `RuleKind: "type-size"`).
 *     Per-rule kind escalation handles that split.
 *   - `interactive-patterns` is structural — focus rings register on
 *     interaction, not at first glance.
 *   - `composition-patterns` is structural — article, tracker,
 *     comparison, and card shapes change hierarchy and scanning behavior.
 *   - `theming-architecture` and `token-architecture` are rhythmic —
 *     they're plumbing, perceptible only via downstream symptoms.
