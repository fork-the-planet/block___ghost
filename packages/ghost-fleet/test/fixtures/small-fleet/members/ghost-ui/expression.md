# Character

A monochromatic editorial language — color is reserved for state, the
default surface stays achromatic. Type runs tight; pill-shaped controls
contrast moderately rounded containers.

# Signature

- Achromatic by default; chromatic accents reserved for semantic state
- Pill controls (radius 999) against moderately rounded containers (10–14)
- Tight display line-heights with system-ui throughout

# Decisions

### color-strategy

Treat hue as opt-in communication. The default theme is pure achromatic.

### shape-language

Pill-first for actionable controls; moderate radii for structural surfaces.
