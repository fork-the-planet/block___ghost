# Ghost - Product Fingerprints

Ghost captures product identity in a repo-local fingerprint bundle:

```text
.ghost/
  fingerprint.yml
  checks.yml        # optional deterministic gates
  intent.md         # optional human-approved intent
  decisions/        # optional accepted/rejected rationale
  proposals/        # optional candidate updates
  cache/            # optional generated caches
```

`fingerprint.yml` is the canonical product-experience memory. Checks are
deterministic gates. Proposals capture missing memory, intentional divergence,
experience gaps, and check candidates until a human promotes them. The host
agent reads and writes the fingerprint; the CLI provides deterministic
validation, comparison, routing, and handoff packets.

## CLI Verbs

| Verb | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ghost init [dir] [--with-intent]` | Create the root `.ghost` memory skeleton. |
| `ghost scan [dir] [--format json]` | Report fingerprint memory presence and readiness. |
| `ghost inventory [path]` | Emit raw repo signals for optional cache/source material. |
| `ghost lint [file-or-dir]` | Validate a bundle or individual artifact. |
| `ghost verify [dir] --root <dir>` | Validate fingerprint evidence, checks, and optional decisions/proposals. |
| `ghost survey <op>` | Legacy/cache survey helpers for optional inventory workflows. |
| `ghost check --base <ref>` | Run active deterministic gates against a diff. |
| `ghost review --base <ref>` | Emit an advisory review packet grounded in bundle evidence. |
| `ghost compare <a> <b> [...more]` | Compare root bundles or direct fingerprints. |
| `ghost ack` / `track` / `diverge` | Record stance toward tracked drift. |
| `ghost emit <kind>` | Emit `review-command` or `context-bundle`. |
| `ghost skill install` | Install this unified skill bundle. |

## Workflows

- Fingerprint Capture: follow [references/capture.md](references/capture.md).
- Author fingerprint patterns: follow [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md).
- Recall accepted product-experience context: follow [references/recall.md](references/recall.md).
- Shape a pre-generation brief: follow [references/brief.md](references/brief.md).
- Critique generated or changed work: follow [references/critique.md](references/critique.md).
- Review drift: follow [references/review.md](references/review.md).
- Verify generation: follow [references/verify.md](references/verify.md).
- Compare bundles: follow [references/compare.md](references/compare.md).
- Remediate drift: follow [references/remediate.md](references/remediate.md).
- Propose a candidate fingerprint update: follow [references/propose.md](references/propose.md).
- Promote a human-approved proposal: follow [references/promote.md](references/promote.md).

## Always

- Treat `.ghost/` as the source of truth.
- Validate with `ghost lint` and `ghost verify --root <target>` before declaring Fingerprint Capture complete.
- Run `ghost check` for deterministic gates and `ghost review` for advisory critique.
- Include accepted decisions with `ghost review --include-memory` when product-experience rationale matters.

## Never

- Never treat advisory composition judgment as a CI gate.
- Never invent product-experience memory absent from `fingerprint.yml`.
- Never treat `intent.md` as authoritative unless human-authored or human-approved.
- Never treat proposals or rejected decisions as canonical inputs.
