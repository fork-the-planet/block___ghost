# Ghost Fingerprint Package Reference

Canonical package:

```text
.ghost/
  manifest.yml        ghost.fingerprint-package/v1: schema + id
  glossary.md         kind vocabulary + meanings + optional posture
  materials/          bundled materials; never a node source
  <kind>.<slug>.md    a brand truth of a declared kind
  <slug>.md           a brand truth without a kind
  checks/             optional review assertions; never a node source
```

Reserved at the root: `manifest.yml`, `glossary.md`, `materials/`, and
`checks/`. Every other `*.md` is a node.

## Glossary posture

A kind may declare posture. Omitted posture defaults to `steady`.

```yaml
kinds:
  - name: principle
  - name: anti-goal
    posture: guard
  - name: provocation
    posture: wild
```

- `steady`: default, gathered normally.
- `guard`: review-critical negative space. Stays in default gather, appears at
  the tail of `ghost pull`, and is auto-offered by `ghost review` when its
  materials match touched files.
- `wild`: deliberate push beyond the fingerprint. Default gather excludes wild
  kinds unless `--wild` is explicit.

## Nodes

A node is markdown with frontmatter and a prose body:

```markdown
---
description: Logo lockups, clearspace, and when the glyph can stand alone.
materials:
  - brand/logo*.svg
  - https://figma.com/file/example?node-id=logo-lockups
---

Use the full lockup when recognition matters.
```

- Identity is the filename minus `.md`.
- Kind is the first dotted segment of the filename.
- `description` is the retrieval payload shown by `ghost gather`.
- `materials` accepts repo-relative paths/globs plus absolute HTTPS URLs. It is
  a locator list, not guidance.

Ghost derives whether a node carries concrete material from structure: non-empty
`materials`, a fenced code block of at least 3 lines, or a `## Skeleton` section.
This is reported in gather/pulse and used for pull ordering.

## Skeleton convention

A `## Skeleton` section contains the literal opening structure for a surface.
It should contain exactly one fenced block; `ghost validate` warns, never fails,
when a Skeleton section has zero or multiple fences.

```markdown
## Skeleton

```tsx
<section>
  <h1>{status}</h1>
  <button>{nextStep}</button>
</section>
```
```

`ghost pull` extracts Skeleton fences and emits them dead last under a banner
instructing the agent to begin from that structure verbatim.

## Checks

Checks live under `.ghost/checks/*.md` and are never gathered or pulled:

```markdown
---
name: logo-clearspace-holds
description: Logo usage preserves clearspace and lockup integrity.
severity: medium
references:
  - asset.logo
probe: pnpm test:logo-clearspace
---

Grade whether the change preserves the logo guidance in `asset.logo`.
```

`references` are node ids with optional heading anchors. `probe` is optional: a
repo-root shell command that `ghost review` runs for offered checks by default
(timeout 30s; stdout/stderr truncated). Probe output is evidence only, never a
Ghost pass/fail verdict. Use `ghost review --no-probes` to skip. Trust model:
probes are the same class as npm scripts; Git review is the boundary.

## Gather / Pull / Review

- `ghost gather` emits the node menu, including coverage counts. Checks are
  invisible.
- `ghost pull` emits selected nodes in steering order and inlines small local
  materials. Binary local materials become inspect-pointers.
- `ghost review` matches diff files to local node materials, offers relevant
  checks and matched guard nodes, embeds probe evidence, and emits a packet for
  the host agent to judge.
