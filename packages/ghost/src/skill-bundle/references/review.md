# Recipe: Review Code Changes For Experience Drift

## 1. Run The Gate

```bash
ghost check --base <ref>
```

Fix deterministic failures first. These come from active
`fingerprint/enforcement/checks.yml` rules and are the only blocking findings.

## 2. Build Advisory Context

```bash
ghost review --base <ref>
```

Use the emitted packet as context. It includes:

- `fingerprint/prose.yml`, `fingerprint/inventory.yml`, and `fingerprint/composition.yml`
- curated inventory exemplars
- active checks from `fingerprint/enforcement/checks.yml`
- optional stack, config, intent, or accepted decision context when present or requested
- the diff

## 3. Write Advisory Findings

Advisory findings are non-blocking unless tied to an active deterministic check.
Classify each finding as `fix`, `intentional-divergence`, `missing-memory`,
`experience-gap`, or `eval-uncertainty`.

Each finding must cite the diff location, relevant fingerprint core layer refs,
exemplars when useful, active check when blocking, and repair or
intentional-divergence rationale.

When fingerprint layers are silent, local evidence can still support advisory
critique. Label those findings as provisional and non-Ghost-backed.

Fingerprint edits are ordinary Git-reviewed edits to the split fingerprint
package and optional rationale files. Do not silently rewrite the Ghost package
during review unless the user asks for fingerprint edits.
