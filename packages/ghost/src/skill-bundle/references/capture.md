# Recipe: Author Ghost Fingerprint

**Goal:** record durable product-experience memory in `.ghost/fingerprint/`.
If a change is uncommitted or unmerged, it is draft work. If it is checked in,
Ghost treats the fingerprint package as canonical.

```text
.ghost/
  config.yml
  fingerprint/
    manifest.yml
    prose.yml
    inventory.yml
    composition.yml
    enforcement/checks.yml
    memory/intent.md
    memory/decisions/
    sources/cache/
```

`prose.yml` answers what matters and why. `inventory.yml` records curated
materials, exemplars, and source links. `composition.yml` records how those
materials become recognizable experience. Checks validate output after
generation; they are not generation input.

## Steps

### 1. Classify The Authoring Scenario

Before initialization or edits, decide which authoring posture fits this repo.
Follow [authoring-scenarios.md](authoring-scenarios.md) when the user is setting
up or substantially revising a fingerprint.

Common starting points:

- Net new repos are mostly human-led because the repo has little evidence.
- Net new repos with a UI library combine human intent with library scans.
- Existing repos combine human judgment with code, docs, route, story, and
  exemplar scans.
- Existing repos with mixed quality require curation before repeated patterns
  become canonical.
- Monorepos and product suites need a nested-package decision pass before local
  surfaces inherit or add guidance.

Human intent decides product identity. Scans provide evidence. Agent synthesis
is draft work until a human curates it and ordinary Git review accepts it.

If the user asks for `auto-draft`, keep this same boundary: the mode may create
starter edits, but it does not make scan output canonical.

### 2. Initialize

```bash
ghost init
ghost scan
```

Use `--with-intent` only when you have human-authored or human-approved context
to preserve. Use `--with-config --reference <path-or-registry>` when local
routing or a reference UI registry/library should be recorded in `.ghost/config.yml`.

### 3. Auto-Draft Mode

Use this branch only when the user explicitly asks for auto-draft, such as:

```text
Set up the Ghost fingerprint for this repo with auto-draft.
```

Auto-draft is a skill workflow, not a Ghost CLI action or flag.

1. If `.ghost/fingerprint/manifest.yml` is missing, run `ghost init`.
2. Run `ghost scan --format json`.
3. Create generated cache:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .ghost/fingerprint/sources/cache
   ghost inventory . > .ghost/fingerprint/sources/cache/inventory.json
   ```

4. Inspect high-signal files from the inventory, plus routes, docs, stories,
   tests, tokens, registries, assets, screenshots, and exemplars.
5. Write only the smallest evidence-backed starter entries into
   `prose.yml`, `inventory.yml`, and `composition.yml`.
6. Ask the human to keep, soften, reject, scope, record, or convert important
   claims before treating them as durable fingerprint guidance.

If evidence is thin, contradictory, or mostly implementation plumbing, write
less and ask more. Do not fill core layers with speculative product claims.

### 4. Orient

Read the product, not just the component library. Look for surfaces, docs,
tests, stories, routes, screenshots, or examples that reveal identity,
hierarchy, behavior, copy, accessibility, and trust.

Optional helper:

```bash
mkdir -p .ghost/fingerprint/sources/cache
ghost inventory . > .ghost/fingerprint/sources/cache/inventory.json
```

Treat generated cache as scratch material. Do not copy raw inventory into
`inventory.yml` without judgment.

### 5. Write Core Layers

Edit the smallest useful durable layer content:

- `prose.yml`: summary, situations, principles, and experience contracts.
- `inventory.yml`: topology, building blocks, exemplars, and `sources[]` links.
- `composition.yml`: rules, layouts, structures, flows, states, content,
  behavior, and visual arrangements.

Prefer a few high-confidence entries over a comprehensive but noisy catalog.
Ask the human to keep, soften, reject, scope, or record important claims before
treating draft content as durable fingerprint guidance.

### 6. Add Checks Sparingly

`fingerprint/enforcement/checks.yml` is the executable appendix. Add only
deterministic checks with typed derivation refs:

```yaml
derivation:
  composition:
    - composition.pattern:resource-index-stays-tabular
```

Ref-backed checks are preferred. Missing or unresolved derivation refs lint as
warnings. Inventory can support a check, but inventory-only grounding is not
product judgment by itself.

### 7. Validate

```bash
ghost lint .ghost
ghost verify .ghost --root <target>
ghost check --base HEAD
```

Use `ghost lint --all` and `ghost verify --all` only when nested fingerprint
packages exist.

## Never

- Never describe any file outside `.ghost/fingerprint/` as canonical package input.
- Never treat generated cache as canonical inventory.
- Never treat auto-draft as a CLI feature or a replacement for human curation.
- Never invent product-experience obligations absent from evidence or human direction.
- Never promote subjective judgment directly into checks; make it deterministic or keep it advisory.
