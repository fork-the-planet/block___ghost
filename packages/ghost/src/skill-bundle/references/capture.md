# Recipe: Author Ghost Fingerprint Memory

**Goal:** record durable product-experience memory in `.ghost/fingerprint.yml`.
If a change is uncommitted or unmerged, it is draft work. If it is checked in,
Ghost treats it as canonical memory.

```text
.ghost/
  fingerprint.yml # canonical product-experience memory
  checks.yml      # optional deterministic gates
```

`fingerprint.yml` answers what matters and why. `checks.yml` contains only
optional active gates. Git is the approval boundary; Ghost does not manage a
separate memory lifecycle.

Generation uses product prose, optional generated inventory, and curated
exemplars. Checks validate output after generation; they are not generation
memory.

`fingerprint.yml` may start sparse:

```yaml
schema: ghost.fingerprint/v1
```

Add only sections that contain real memory. Ghost normalizes omitted top-level
sections internally, so an empty project does not need placeholder arrays or
objects.

Optional files may appear beside the core files: `intent.md` for human-authored
context, `decisions/` for historical rationale, `config.yml` for implementation
routing, and `cache/` for explicit generated inventory.

## Steps

### 1. Initialize

```bash
ghost init
ghost scan
```

Use `--with-intent` only when you have human-authored or human-approved context
to preserve. New projects may start with an empty but valid fingerprint and add
memory as product choices become real.

Use `--with-config --reference <path-or-registry>` when the product uses a
reference UI registry or library. This writes implementation routing into
`.ghost/config.yml` and records only implementation vocabulary in the blank
product fingerprint; it does not copy reference memory into product intent.

For a monorepo or deeply scoped product area, `ghost init --scope <path>` is an
advanced option. Keep broad product identity in the root bundle and put local
situations, patterns, and checks in the child only when scoped memory is needed.

### 2. Orient

Read the product, not just the component library. Look for surfaces, docs,
tests, stories, routes, screenshots, or examples that reveal identity,
hierarchy, behavior, copy, accessibility, and trust.

Optional helper:

```bash
mkdir -p .ghost/cache
ghost inventory . > .ghost/cache/inventory.json
```

Treat cache output as scratch material. Do not copy raw inventory into
fingerprint memory without judgment.

### 3. Write Memory

Edit `fingerprint.yml` with the smallest useful durable memory. Omit sections
until they have real entries:

- `summary`: product identity, audience, goals, anti-goals, tradeoffs, tone.
- `topology`: scopes and surface types.
- `situations`: user/task/state moments that change obligations.
- `principles`: durable product-experience truths.
- `experience_contracts`: behavior, disclosure, failure, recovery, and trust.
- `patterns`: visual, behavioral, content, and composition patterns.
- `exemplars`: concrete surfaces that show what good looks like.
- `implementation_vocabulary`: current tokens, components, libraries, assets,
  and notes that may help implement the product memory.

Prefer a few high-confidence entries over a comprehensive but noisy catalog.
Every entry should help a future agent make or review a product change.

### 4. Add Checks Sparingly

`checks.yml` is the executable appendix. Add only deterministic checks with a
typed `derives_from` reference into `fingerprint.yml`.

```yaml
derives_from: pattern:resource-index-stays-tabular
```

Keep speculative checks out of `checks.yml` until they have a deterministic
detector and evidence. Proposed checks may use `status: proposed` because check
enforcement still has its own lifecycle.

### 5. Validate

```bash
ghost lint .ghost
ghost verify .ghost --root <target>
ghost check --base HEAD
```

`lint` validates canonical shape, `verify` validates evidence paths and typed
check refs, and `check` runs only active deterministic gates.

Use `ghost lint --all` and `ghost verify --all` only when nested memory bundles
exist.

## Gaps

If the repo does not yet contain enough product experience to record, say so.
When memory is silent, continue from nearby product surfaces, local components,
token and copy conventions, optional rationale files when present, and ordinary
UX judgment when safe. Label that reasoning as provisional and
non-Ghost-backed.

## Never

- Never describe root-level `fingerprint.md` as canonical.
- Never treat generated inventory as canonical memory.
- Never invent product-experience obligations absent from evidence or human
  direction.
- Never promote subjective judgment directly into `checks.yml`; make it
  deterministic or keep it advisory.
