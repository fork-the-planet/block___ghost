# Recipe: Verify Ghost Work

1. Run `ghost lint .ghost` and `ghost verify .ghost --root <target>` after
   fingerprint edits.
2. Run `ghost check --base <ref>` after implementation changes.
3. For advisory review, run `ghost review --base <ref> --include-memory`.
4. For generation setup, run `ghost emit context-bundle` and inspect the
   compact entrypoint first, then follow suggested reads into prose, inventory,
   composition, and active checks when the task widens.
5. Inspect generated UI manually or with screenshots when visual fidelity
   matters.

Report:

- Active-check failures and repairs.
- Advisory surface-composition drift with citations.
- Missing or unreachable evidence and exemplar paths.
- Provisional local reasoning where fingerprint layers are silent.
- Any fingerprint edits the user requested.

Fingerprint edits should be validated before handoff. Implementation-only work
does not need Ghost package edits unless the user asks for them.
