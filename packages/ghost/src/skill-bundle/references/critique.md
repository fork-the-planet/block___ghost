# Recipe: Critique Generated Work

1. Run `ghost review --base <ref>` or inspect the changed files directly.
2. Read checked-in `fingerprint.yml` and active checks.
3. Compare the work against the relevant prose and composition patterns.
4. Inspect relevant inventory exemplars as concrete anchors for what good looks like.
5. Lead with actionable findings. Cite diff locations, fingerprint refs,
   inventory exemplars, active checks, and repairs where relevant.

When fingerprint layers are silent, you may use nearby product surfaces, local
components, token and copy conventions, accepted decisions, or human intent when
present. Label that reasoning as provisional and non-Ghost-backed.

Do not make advisory taste judgment sound blocking unless an active check backs
it. If fingerprint grounding or layer coverage is missing or contradictory,
name that as `missing-memory` or `experience-gap`; edit the Ghost package only
when the user asks you to.
