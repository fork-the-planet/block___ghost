# Recipe: Collaborative Fingerprint Authoring

**Goal:** help a human and agent co-author durable brand truths through
conversation — without laundering what a codebase happens to do into what the
brand means.

The fingerprint is medium-agnostic and is not derived from a repo. Its raw
material is **elicitation**: what the human says, shows, and points at — words,
screenshots, links, exemplar products, marketing copy, a competitor they define
themselves against. Agent synthesis is draft work until the human curates it
and ordinary Git review accepts it.

Repo-bound reality — components, tokens, paths, building blocks — can be
recorded as `materials` on the node whose prose explains their purpose. When a
conversation surfaces "we have a component for that," treat it as material to
locate and interpret, not as brand truth by itself.

## 1. Start With One Repeated Decision

Do not try to fingerprint the whole brand at once. Ask the human for the one
decision whose feedback keeps repeating — the checkout always flagged for
trust, the voice always re-toned, the empty state always rewritten — and
capture that one truth as a node first. One high-confidence truth beats an
empty catalog; the fingerprint grows as the next repeated decision shows up.

The scenario below tunes the authoring *posture* for that first node; it is not
a gate to clear before writing anything.

| Scenario | Default authoring posture |
| --- | --- |
| Net new brand | Stance-first. Elicit feel, audience, and early anti-goals before anything else exists to point at. |
| Established brand, first fingerprint | Artifact-rich interview. The human can show a lot — shipped surfaces, brand docs, campaigns. Elicit which of it is *intentional*. |
| Strong opinions, weak articulation | Example-led. The human knows it when they see it: work from exemplars and counter-exemplars ("this feels like us, this never would") toward the stance underneath. |
| Brand doc or design-language deck exists | Distillation. The document is testimony, not truth: pull the claims that actually steer decisions, drop the aspirational filler, and have the human ratify each survivor. |
| Rebrand, redesign, migration | Transition-led. Capture current, target, and what must not be lost in between. |
| Fork, white label, tenant variant | Shared base + local divergence. Keep common truths broad; scope divergence with conditions. |
| Monorepo or product suite | One contract per package. |

If more than one applies, start with the broad scenario, then narrow.

## 2. Interview The Human

The interview is the engine. Ask only high-leverage questions that change the
fingerprint:

- What should this brand feel like, and what should it never become? (The
  "never become" answers are anti-goal nodes — capture them with the same care
  as the affirmative stance.)
- Who is the audience, and what are they trying to get done?
- Which surfaces, campaigns, or moments show the brand at its best? Show me.
- Which brand or product do you admire — and where do you deliberately differ?
  (The deliberate differences also route to anti-goal nodes: the rejected
  neighbor, named.)
- What keeps getting flagged in review, re-toned, or rewritten?
- Where do trust, density, pacing, accessibility, recovery, or disclosure
  matter most?
- Which truths are universal, and which only hold under a specific situation?

Capture human-authored or human-approved answers as nodes. Do not treat
unapproved notes as canonical.

## 3. Work The Material The Human Brings

Ask for artifacts and read them closely: screenshots, links, exemplar products,
brand docs, marketing copy, past campaigns, a rejected design and why it was
rejected. Treat every artifact as *testimony* — evidence of a stance the human
holds — never as truth by itself. A pattern that appears everywhere may be
legacy; a pattern that appears once may be the brand at its best. The human
says which.

Counter-exemplars are as valuable as exemplars when they name the replacement.
"We would never ship this; we would ship that instead" with artifacts attached
usually yields a sharper guard than an hour of affirmative description. Avoid
blacklist-only anti-goals: the rejected pattern should be purged from exemplars
and enforced in review, not repeated as the model's main example.

## 4. Draft The Nodes

Write the smallest useful set of nodes, each a purpose-coherent prose truth with
a one-line `description`, named `<kind>.<slug>.md` (or a bare slug when no kind is present). Ask three questions of each body: why (the stance), with what
(the materials), and how it is assembled (the patterns). These are drafting
prompts, not fields.

Draft only what the human said or showed. State universal truths plainly; give
narrower truths a **condition** in the prose — the situation they apply in,
never a destination. Label uncertain reasoning as provisional. Prefer a few
high-confidence truths over a broad catalog. Hold draft prose to the node prose
stances in [capture.md](capture.md) and score each node against its drafting
gate before presenting drafts for curation.

## 5. Curate With The Human

Before treating draft content as durable, ask the human to classify important
claims:

- keep as canonical
- soften into guidance
- reject as accidental or legacy
- move to scratch notes
- restate at a broader or narrower altitude (add or drop a condition)

## 6. Decide Kinds And Altitude

Two authoring decisions replace any notion of hierarchy:

- **Kind** — declare the kind vocabulary in `glossary.md` and name each node
  `<kind>.<slug>.md` so its normative weight is clear. The glossary defines what
  each kind means and how strongly it binds. Use `posture: guard` for
  review-critical replacement nodes, `posture: wild` for opt-in provocations,
  and the default steady posture for ordinary truths. Kinds are your choice;
  Ghost ships no fixed vocabulary.
- **Altitude** — state a truth at the level it is actually true. Universal → state
  it plainly. Narrower → name the situation that activates it, in the prose. Never
  file a truth by destination (`for-emails.md`); the model reads the condition and
  decides when it applies.

## 7. Validate And Ratify

```bash
ghost validate .ghost
```

`validate` checks artifact shape, per-node validity, and that each node's kind
prefix is a declared glossary kind (undeclared → warning with a "did you
mean" suggestion). Use ordinary Git review as the approval boundary: uncommitted
edits are drafts; checked-in nodes are canonical.

## Never

- Never derive brand truth from repo code alone; what the codebase repeats may
  be legacy, not stance. Use repo paths as `materials` only after the prose
  truth has been curated.
- Never draft a node the human neither said nor showed; that is invention
  wearing the brand's clothes.
- Never treat a brand doc, an artifact, or repetition frequency as brand
  authority; the human ratifies what is intentional.
- Never invent a hierarchy, inheritance, or edges — the package is flat.
- Never file a truth by destination; state its condition in the prose.
