# Brief From The Ghost Fingerprint

Use this before generating or implementing product UI. The goal is to turn
repo-local memory into a concise working brief: what the agent should preserve,
where it has freedom, and what needs human judgment.

## Steps

1. Resolve the memory stack for the task path with `ghost stack <path>` when a
   path is known.
2. Read merged `fingerprint.yml` memory broad-to-local.
3. Select the relevant `situation` for the task, or state that none fits.
4. Pull applicable `principles`, `experience_contracts`, and `patterns`.
5. Read `implementation_vocabulary` only as current replaceable material.
6. Read merged checks for active deterministic gates.
7. Skim open proposals from the stack for gaps or intentional divergences.
8. Name missing or contradictory memory explicitly.

## Output

Produce:

- Task framing and selected situation.
- Relevant principles and experience contracts.
- Product-native pattern guidance.
- Implementation vocabulary that may help satisfy the product memory.
- Active checks to run afterward.
- Open proposals or known gaps.
- Decisions the human should make before generation.

Do not invent fingerprint context. If memory is missing, apply the Proposal
Threshold before recommending memory action. A proposal candidate should be
repeated, high-impact, explicitly human-stated, intentionally divergent, likely
to recur, or blocking confident future review; otherwise name the gap as local
uncertainty. If it qualifies, say which proposal type should be recorded after
the work: `missing-memory`, `intentional-divergence`, `experience-gap`, or
`check-candidate`.
