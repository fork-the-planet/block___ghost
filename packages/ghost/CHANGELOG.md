## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- [#231](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/231) [`d87886e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/d87886e0727d25c8b0a8d2993e2943293ee216f4) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `gather` and `pull` accept an optional run identifier (`--run <id>` or
  `GHOST_RUN_ID`) and stamp it onto their events-tape lines as `run`. Hosts
  that invoke Ghost per task can now attribute tape events to a specific run
  exactly, instead of guessing by time window. When no identifier is supplied,
  tape lines are byte-identical to before — the field is attribution only and
  never affects gather or pull output.

### Patch Changes

- [#231](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/231) [`d87886e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/d87886e0727d25c8b0a8d2993e2943293ee216f4) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - serializeNode preserves the materials frontmatter field instead of dropping it.

## 0.22.1

### Patch Changes

- [#229](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/229) [`e45fe48`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/e45fe4823757af90df4504aced8f5ba3677f03a6) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - serializeNode preserves the materials frontmatter field instead of dropping it.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- [#221](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/221) [`ff5206e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/ff5206e191909ee3de5eac5adaa13a6230961fc7) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Adds a manifest `cover` field — gather inlines the named node above the menu, validate enforces it — and re-authors the skeleton starter in designer-native vocabulary: a brand cover, foundation chapters with open questions, context nodes, and a cliche floor paired with checks.

- [#221](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/221) [`ff5206e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/ff5206e191909ee3de5eac5adaa13a6230961fc7) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Removes the glossary posture system. Glossary kinds no longer accept a posture key; `ghost gather` drops the `--wild` flag and lists every node; `ghost pull` orders packets as index, concrete nodes, then prose; `ghost review` reports matched material-backed nodes without a separate review-critical section and renames the `unguarded-material` coverage gap to `unchecked-material`; `ghost pulse` drops the wild usage section. Existing fingerprints keep working: an ignored `posture` key in `glossary.md` frontmatter is tolerated, and anti-goal nodes still gather, pull, and match in review through their materials like any node.

- [#221](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/221) [`ff5206e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/ff5206e191909ee3de5eac5adaa13a6230961fc7) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost validate` warns on nodes without a `description` (rule `node-description-missing`), and the `ghost gather` coverage line reports how many nodes lack descriptions, since an undescribed node is invisible to agent selection.

### Patch Changes

- [#221](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/221) [`ff5206e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/ff5206e191909ee3de5eac5adaa13a6230961fc7) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add the concrete-tiers skill recipe: choosing which concrete code tiers (tokens, skeletons, components, exemplars) a fingerprint carries, and justifying absences.

- [#221](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/221) [`ff5206e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/ff5206e191909ee3de5eac5adaa13a6230961fc7) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Treat the manifest cover as inlined context instead of asking agents to select an `index` node.

- [#221](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/221) [`ff5206e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/ff5206e191909ee3de5eac5adaa13a6230961fc7) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Document bound/open pattern authoring and `concept.*` nodes in the capture skill recipe; deduplicate the package README against the root README.

- [#221](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/221) [`ff5206e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/ff5206e191909ee3de5eac5adaa13a6230961fc7) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Make `GHOST_PACKAGE_DIR` honored by every command, not just `init` and `validate`; support `goose` in the `install.sh` curl installer; and drop detection of the pre-flat legacy checks directory entirely.

- [#216](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/216) [`c95f58b`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/c95f58b91b36b4ac7421fd33d77b5f5ecadbcbb4) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Refresh the entrance docs: accurate skeleton/body init descriptions, a documented `ghost export`, and plainer language on the welcome path.

- [#221](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/221) [`ff5206e`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/ff5206e191909ee3de5eac5adaa13a6230961fc7) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Reconciles the vessel-light starter body: every token and primitive class is now demonstrated in a reference or removed, display type has one answer, and a closure check keeps the materials contract enforced.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- [#207](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/207) [`27d5ebd`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/27d5ebdc795d1ed5a7468c823d48dc1c23f23936) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - The skill bundle gains the `adapting-a-starter` recipe: the seven-step transplant procedure for turning an installed starter — a body like vessel-light or the naked skeleton — into your own brand's fingerprint, plus guidance for consuming an unadapted starter honestly.

- [#207](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/207) [`27d5ebd`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/27d5ebdc795d1ed5a7468c823d48dc1c23f23936) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost init` gains `--body vessel-light`: install a full inhabited fingerprint package — answered signature dials, a materials tree with tokens and embedded fonts, annotated reference compositions, and its own checks. Init template payloads now ship as packed files in dist, so bodies can carry binary materials.

- [#207](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/207) [`27d5ebd`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/27d5ebdc795d1ed5a7468c823d48dc1c23f23936) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - The median floor gets one authored home: `anti-goal.median` rules become markdown headings with per-rule check references, so `ghost validate` warns on every flag orphaned by pruning. All init templates (`skeleton`, `minimal`, `composition`) now stamp the median node; `ghost checks init` copies the paired check from the packaged payload and skips it when the node is absent.

- [#207](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/207) [`27d5ebd`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/27d5ebdc795d1ed5a7468c823d48dc1c23f23936) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost init` now scaffolds the skeleton starter: value-free grammar nodes, unanswered signature dials, and the `anti-goal.median` floor — replacing the Morrow Ledger demo content. `ghost checks init` scaffolds a live median-tells check alongside the example. `steering` remains as an alias for the new `skeleton` template.

### Patch Changes

- [#207](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/207) [`27d5ebd`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/27d5ebdc795d1ed5a7468c823d48dc1c23f23936) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Reframe the median as Ghost-stamped model truth and align Vessel's median check with heading anchors.

- [#207](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/207) [`27d5ebd`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/27d5ebdc795d1ed5a7468c823d48dc1c23f23936) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost review` now resolves package-relative `materials/…` locators to their repo-relative form before matching diff paths, so packages living below the repo root offer their value checks correctly.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add `ghost.binding/v1` (`.ghost.bind.yml`) and the path road: a repo path
  resolves to the surface that owns it (directory-default binding or explicit
  declaration), and `ghost gather --path <file>` composes that surface's slice.
  The contract still carries no paths — bindings own all path matching.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost checks` and `ghost review` now route by catalog references and ground from the selected prose packet: grounding is the surface's gathered nodes by provenance (own / ancestor / edge), replacing the typed why/what (principles, contracts, patterns, exemplars) split — the why and what now live in each node's prose. `ghost checks` gains `--as <incarnation>` to filter grounding to one output form. Exemplar `path:` is dropped from grounding.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Reduce the fingerprint collection to a flat catalog: remove the `checks`, `review`, and `migrate` commands, drop node `relates` edges and traversal, and reduce `gather` to emitting the menu the agent selects from.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove check surface routing: every check is now offered to the reviewer and the agent judges relevance, so the check `surface:` field, `selectChecksForSurfaces`, `RoutedCheck`, and `CheckRelevance` are gone. Checks bind to the fingerprint through an optional `source:` pointer (`node > Heading`) that `review` surfaces so a finding can cite the prose it enforces.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost init --template composition` scaffolds a composition-steering starter: the default files plus an invariants floor (`principle.composition`), a worked bound/open/refines pattern node, a glossary whose `pattern` and `principle` kinds carry the binding-depth convention, and an index that teaches the ladder — patterns when they match, principles as the floor when they don't, narrowing-only between them.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Adds opt-in wild consumption posture for glossary kinds and gather/pull/pulse observability.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Recompose `gather` on a corridor + hub-and-spoke model and fix a sibling-surface
  context leak. A surface's slice is now: a **spine** of full-body nodes from every
  file on the corridor (the package root down to the surface's own folder — folders
  are walls, so sibling folders never leak in), the **edges** reachable in one hop
  from any spine node's `relates` (so a broad rule authored once high in the tree —
  e.g. `relates: { to: arcade }` on `features/` — reaches every descendant), and a
  set of **spokes**: pointer entries (id + description) for the surface's own
  descendants and any edge hub's subtree, which the agent pulls on demand. The
  `CatalogSlice` JSON gains a `spokes` array; catalog nodes carry their file `folder`.
  Grounding for `checks`/`review` remains the full-body spine + edges.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add cross-package inheritance via `extends`. A package's `manifest.yml` can declare `extends: { <id>: <dir> }`, mapping another contract's identity to where it lives. Node refs then reference inherited context by identity, never path — `relates: [{ to: brand:core/trust }]` (the `<package-id>:<path>` form replaces the earlier npm-style `<pkg>#<id>` ref grammar). Inherited nodes load read-only and flow into gather and validate like local ones. `ghost validate` resolves cross-package refs and reports unresolved refs, packages not declared in `extends`, identity mismatches, and cross-package cycles. This delivers the shared-brand story: one brand contract extended by many products, without copy-paste or merge. One level of `extends` in v1 (no transitive); location is an explicit relative dir (identity-based discovery is a future upgrade that keeps refs unchanged).

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Make `description` a first-class node field — the retrieval payload an agent matches a task against, the way a tool is selected by name + description. `ghost gather` with no argument now lists nodes by id + description (the catalog), built from the catalog rather than a separate surface menu. Node frontmatter is now passthrough: free-form descriptive keys (`audience`, `stage`, …) are allowed and ride along untouched. The surface composition-edge vocabulary (`composes`/`governed-by`) is removed — lateral composition lives on node `relates`.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Collapse the on-disk node model into the directory tree: the layout supplies the
  catalog. A node's id is its file path (`marketing/email.md` → `marketing/email`)
  and its parent is its containing directory; a surface is just a directory, and a
  directory's own prose lives in its `index.md` (the package-root `index.md` is
  the implicit `core` node). The `surfaces.yml` spine file and the `nodes/`
  directory are removed, along with the node frontmatter `id` and `under` fields —
  identity and containment now come from where a file sits, never from frontmatter
  or a declared spine. Node frontmatter carries descriptive properties only
  (`description`, `relates`, `incarnation`, plus passthrough keys); `relates` and
  cross-package `extends` refs are path ids (`core/trust`, `brand:core/trust`).
  `ghost init` scaffolds `manifest.yml` + a core `index.md`; `ghost migrate`
  writes a directory tree; any `*.md` outside the reserved `checks/` subtree lints
  as a node. Moving a node is a rename — `ghost validate` reports `relates` that no
  longer resolve.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Export `parseSourceRef` and `sliceNodeSection` from the core entrypoint: the shared parser for a check's `source:` reference grammar (`node-id > Heading`) and a helper to slice the referenced section out of a node body.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Bindings can reference an external contract: a `.ghost.bind.yml` `contract:` now
  accepts an npm package name (`@scope/brand`) in addition to `.` (in-repo),
  resolved from `node_modules`. `ghost verify` checks the external contract
  resolves and that each bound surface exists in it. External fingerprint loading
  for grounding remains a follow-up.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove the facet model — the catalog is now the only fingerprint model. The `intent.yml`/`inventory.yml`/`composition.yml` schemas, the `GhostFingerprintDocument`, the facet→node load-time projection, and the dormant facet slice/grounding are deleted; the loader assembles the package's prose nodes directly into the catalog. `ghost lint` and `ghost verify` are replaced by one `ghost validate` verb (artifact shape pass + catalog pass); `ghost emit` is removed. `ghost scan` now reports node/surface contribution instead of facet contribution. Legacy facet packages no longer load directly — `ghost validate`/load fail with guidance to run `ghost migrate`. Structured exemplar-path and evidence verification is dropped (evidence lives in node prose, per the prose-node model).

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add fingerprint grounding to `ghost checks`: for each touched surface, emit the
  _why_ (principles and experience contracts) and the _what good looks like_
  (patterns and exemplars with paths), drawn from that surface's slice and
  inherited from its ancestors. A flagged check can now cite the design intent it
  serves and point at an exemplar. Use `--no-grounding` for relevance only.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add `ghost gather <surface>`: compose a surface's context slice (its own placed
  nodes, cascaded ancestors, and one-hop typed-edge contributions) with
  provenance, or return the surface menu when no surface is named.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost gather` now surfaces the glossary's kind purposes as a menu legend, in both markdown and JSON output, so the menu is self-sufficient selection context.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost gather` now composes its context packet from selected fingerprint catalog nodes and emits nodes-by-provenance prose (own / ancestor / edge), and gains `--as <incarnation>` to filter the packet to one output form (e.g. email, billboard, voice) while always keeping essence (untagged) nodes.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Return the node menu plus closest-id "did you mean" suggestions when `ghost
gather` is given an inexact query, instead of a separate ranked-candidate
  search — the agent re-picks by description from the same menu the no-argument
  form prints. `gather`, `checks`, and `review` all emit the stable
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_SURFACE` code with closest-id suggestions for a node or surface
  that is not in the package.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Rename the `gather` slice vocabulary to plain language. The JSON `slice.spokes`
  field is now `slice.pointers`, and the pointer `kind` `"edge-hub"` is now
  `"related"` with its origin in a `from` field (was `hub`). Docs and the skill
  bundle drop the spine/corridor/hub-and-spoke metaphors; `edge` provenance is
  unchanged.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add `ghost.check/v1`: markdown + frontmatter checks (`name`, `description`,
  `severity`, optional `tools` / `turn-limit`, plus a Ghost `surface:` placement),
  parsed and linted but never executed by Ghost. Markdown files under a `checks/`
  directory lint as checks. This mirrors the established agent-check format so
  Ghost can route and ground checks without owning a check engine.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add local gather/pull event tracing and a pulse report for fingerprint tuning.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add `goose` as a first-class `ghost skill install --agent` destination, installing to `~/.agents/skills` (Goose's canonical global skills directory) and auto-detecting Goose installs.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Ghost validates material locator liveness and inlines small local materials during pull.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add `ghost migrate`: transform a legacy `.ghost/` package onto the directory-tree
  node model — derive surface directories from old `topology.scopes`, place
  single-scope nodes inside them, and report (never guess) any node it cannot place
  unambiguously.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost init` now scaffolds a node package (`manifest.yml` + a core `index.md` node) via a template registry (`--template <name>`, `default` for now) instead of emitting `intent.yml`/`inventory.yml`/`composition.yml`; the `--reference` flag is removed. `ghost migrate` now performs a one-way conversion of legacy/facet packages into a directory tree of nodes (the facet→node projection becomes the writer) and removes the old facet files. The authoring skill (`capture.md`, `SKILL.md`) teaches node authoring with intent/inventory/composition as authoring lenses rather than facet files.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove the path→surface binding (`ghost.binding/v1`, `.ghost.bind.yml`) and all nesting (fingerprint stacks, cross-package discovery): one contract per package, surfaces are the only locality. `checks` and `review` now take agent-stated `--surface <ids>` instead of resolving surfaces from a diff; `gather` takes only a surface or returns the menu. Removed `gather --path`, `checks --diff`, `lint --all`, `verify --all`, `scan --include-nested`, `emit --path`, `init --scope`, and `init --monorepo`. The agent names the touched surfaces; Ghost no longer infers intent from repo location.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Adds `ghost export` to package fingerprints as portable brand artifacts with material locator audits.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove `compare`, `drift`, `ack`, `track`, and `diverge` commands and the direct `fingerprint.md` machinery (parser, writer, semantic diff, decisions/dimensions, embeddings, perceptual prior). These rested on a quantified visual-design-system model (fixed dimensions + decision embeddings) that the catalog reframe abandoned; the concepts are parked for a later rethink (see docs/ideas/compare-drift-fleet-rethink.md). The `./compare` and `./drift` package subpaths and the root `compare`/`drift` exports are removed. `ghost lint` now validates `.ghost/` packages and node/surface/check artifacts only (direct `fingerprint.md` is no longer linted); a `*.md` node file lints as a `ghost.node/v1` node.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove cross-package `extends` and inherited nodes. A Ghost package is a single
  self-contained contract: its `.ghost/` directory tree is the whole fingerprint.
  The manifest no longer accepts `extends`, `relates` targets must be local path
  ids (the `<package>:<path>` colon ref is gone), and the catalog drops the
  `origin` / inherited-node distinction. Use `ghost --package <dir>` to address a
  package; there is no shared-brand inheritance in this version.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Removes the optional-capability subsystem and its per-capability manifest schema. Checks are now a core capability in a flat `.ghost/checks/` directory: scaffold with `ghost checks init` (or `ghost init --with checks`), and `ghost export --no-checks` replaces the old exclusion flag. `ghost validate` flags packages still using the old nested checks location.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove the `incarnation` node field and the `--as` gather/checks flag. Ghost
  fingerprints a single-medium product surface; the cross-medium projection axis
  (essence vs. incarnation, the portability dial) is dropped rather than shipped
  unused. Slices no longer carry an `incarnation` field and `ResolveCatalogSliceOptions`
  is removed.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove the absorbed and dead commands: `relay`, `stack`, `survey`, `diff`, and
  `describe`, along with the relay-only context modules and the `./relay` package
  export. Their intent now lives in the surface model — `gather` for context,
  `checks` for diff-routed governance, and bindings for path resolution. The skill
  bundle teaches the surface workflow.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove the `ghost scan` and `ghost signals` commands and the deterministic repo-inventory subsystem; the host agent does its own repo reconnaissance and `validate`/`gather` cover package inspection.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Collapse to one check format. Remove `ghost.validate/v1`, the `validate.yml`
  facet, the `ghost check` deterministic gate, and the `./govern` export. Ghost
  now has a single check format — markdown `ghost.check/v1`, routed by surface
  (`ghost checks`) and grounded by the fingerprint. `parseUnifiedDiff` moved to a
  neutral module; the `drift` stance ledger is unchanged.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Standardize the internal collection vocabulary on "catalog" to reflect the flat node set: public exports are `GhostCatalog`, `GhostCatalogNode`, `buildCatalogMenu`, `CatalogMenuEntry`, and `assembleCatalog`, and the loaded package exposes a `catalog` field.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Rename the public package from `@anarchitecture/ghost-fingerprint` to `@design-intelligence/ghost`. The `ghost` and `ghost-fingerprint` bins, all subpath exports (`/core`, `/fingerprint`, `/scan`, `/cli`), and the `.ghost/` package format are unchanged; only the npm name moves. Release tags and tarballs now use the `design-intelligence-ghost` prefix.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Rename the npm scope from `@decentralized-design` to `@design-intelligence`; the package is now `@design-intelligence/ghost` and release tarballs/tags use the `design-intelligence-ghost` prefix.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Rename the published package from `@design-intelligence/ghost` to
  `@design-intelligence/ghost`. Ghost is now a family of packages —
  `ghost-fingerprint` (the fingerprint and its CLI), `ghost-adherence` (the
  code-anchored adherence bridge), and `ghost-vessel` (the reference body) —
  and the package name now says which part it is. The `ghost` bin, all export
  subpaths (`/fingerprint`, `/scan`, `/core`, `/cli`), and the `.ghost/`
  on-disk format are unchanged; only the install name moves. Existing installs
  keep working from the old name until it is deprecated on npm with a pointer
  forward.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Collapse the separate adherence package into the fingerprint: nodes carry optional `materials` locators, checks become an opt-in capability of the fingerprint package, and `ghost review` assembles advisory diff packets from material-backed nodes and checks. The external dispatch to a second binary is removed.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Retire the `child-wins-by-id` fingerprint merge (Leak E): nested `.ghost/`
  packages now bind paths to the root contract's surfaces instead of merging their
  own facets in. A path resolves to the single root contract, used as-is — a child
  package can no longer silently override or disable an inherited rule or check.
  The `stack` / `check` / `review` outputs expose `contract` instead of `merged`,
  and drop the `provenance.merge` field.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Rebuild `ghost review` on the surface rails: it now resolves the diff's touched
  surfaces (via bindings), selects the markdown checks governing them, and grounds
  each in the fingerprint slice — instead of emitting `validate.yml` and a
  path-selection context packet. The advisory-review JSON replaces
  `fingerprint` / `context_markdown` / `checks` / `stacks` with `touched_surfaces`,
  `routed_checks`, and `grounding`. `ghost check` remains the deterministic gate.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add a `ghost manifest --format json` command that emits a self-describing manifest of every command and flag, so a host agent can discover the CLI in one call instead of scraping `--help`. The terminal help, docs-site manifest, and this command all derive from one shared `buildCliManifest()` (also exported from `@design-intelligence/ghost/cli`).

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Make the steering starter the default `ghost init` scaffold, move the old small scaffold to `--template minimal`, and mark starter steering content as demo guidance to replace.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Adds steering-ordered pulls, derived concreteness coverage, guard posture review routing, check probes, inspect-pointers for binary materials, and a worked steering starter.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Adds a steering-ready fingerprint template and skill guidance for authoring, briefing, and auditing agent-readable brand steering.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Replace topology/applies_to/surface_type/scope coordinates with a surface
  coordinate space and a single surface placement per node. Remove the
  `ghost.map/v1` (`map.md`) coordinate and routing system; checks now route by
  `applies_to.paths`.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add markdown checks (`ghost.check/v1`) in a package's `checks/` directory.
  `ghost checks --surface <ids>` grounds the named surfaces and offers every
  check; the host agent judges which apply. A check binds to the prose it enforces
  through an optional `source:` pointer (a node id with an optional `> Heading`),
  not by surface routing. Ghost selects, grounds, and emits checks; it never runs
  them.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add node prose stances and a scored drafting gate to the capture recipe so authoring agents hold draft nodes to anti-slop standards before human curation.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove redundant containment bookkeeping in favor of path-derived ids: parent and ancestor facts are derived from node paths, and the redundant parent/children maps are removed.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Remove the dormant context-selection machinery (`buildContextEntrypoint`, `buildSelectedContext`, and selection-reasons) that was inert since the coordinate removal and orphaned once `review` moved onto the surface rails. Internal cleanup; no public surface change.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Align docs and the skill bundle with the prose-bound check model: checks are no
  longer routed by surface, every check is offered and the agent judges which
  apply, and a check binds to prose via its optional `source:` pointer. Fix
  the `ghost scan` next-step hint and skill recipes that referenced a nonexistent
  `ghost check` command.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Refresh the README and docs site onto the current command set (drop the removed
  `lint`/`verify`/`relay`/`describe`/`survey`/`emit` commands).

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Drop two unused runtime dependencies (`jiti`, `tinyglobby`) — neither was imported anywhere in source. Ghost now ships three runtime deps (`cac`, `yaml`, `zod`), shrinking the install footprint by ~1.8 MB. Also fix the build to clear `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` so `dist/` no longer retains deleted modules from incremental builds (the packed package drops from ~1.9 MB / 777 files to ~397 KB / 248 files).

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Print a one-time stderr notice when the local `.ghost/.events` tape is first created, so gather/pull logging is never a surprise.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Make CLI exit codes consistent so an agent can branch on them: unexpected
  errors exit `1`, caller mistakes (bad flags, invalid environment, refused
  overwrites) exit `2` via a typed `UsageError`, and a missing package now exits
  `2` with a `ghost init` hint instead of leaking a raw filesystem error.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Lead fingerprint authoring with a concrete first move — capture the one surface whose review feedback keeps repeating — instead of a scenario-classification step.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add an inventory-lens authoring reference to the skill bundle.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Rewrite the package README onto the flat-corpus model: plain-language framing, current CLI commands only, and removal of stale relation-era shapes (`relates`, surface directories, `checks/` at the fingerprint root, `ghost checks`/`ghost review`/`ghost migrate`).

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Retire the "three lenses" vocabulary: authoring docs now speak the same steering dimensions the CLI scores (stance, concreteness, patterns), and the inventory recipe becomes references/blocks.md with a neutral block kind in its examples.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Add a thesis section to the README: agents changed the unit of design work, the work that compounds is architectural, and Ghost is the artifact those decisions live in.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Clean em dashes out of the shipped skill bundle and package README prose,
  rewriting them as plain sentences, colons, or parentheticals.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Make the glossary the authoritative source of kind semantics in the skill recipes, teach sample and counter-exemplar capture, add an `anti-goal` starter kind, and establish the `index` node as the always-pulled carrier of a fingerprint's non-negotiables and silence posture.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Reorder the skill bundle to lead with the workflow loop and CLI verbs, moving the node-catalog model into a later "How It Works" section.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Teach the authoring lenses and `incarnation`/essence distinction from a shown node example instead of negative definitions ("not fields", "essence is untagged").

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Reframe the package README and description around the fingerprint as a portable brand steering packet.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - Update `ghost validate --help` to describe what validation actually checks today: manifest shape, node validity, material locators, check references, and glossary kind prefixes.

- [#205](https://github.com/block/ghost/pull/205) [`0f94bb9`](https://github.com/block/ghost/commit/0f94bb93746e9940952e2367127dcde58e7e54cd) Thanks [@nahiyankhan](https://github.com/nahiyankhan)! - `ghost validate` now reports a node that fails its own schema instead of silently dropping it from the catalog.
