# Ghost

**Ghost captures the composition of a product surface: the intent behind it,
the materials it draws from, and the patterns that make it feel intentional.**

Ghost gives AI agents a checked-in product fingerprint they can read before
they generate UI and validate after they change it. The public package is
`@anarchitecture/ghost`, and it installs one CLI: `ghost`.

Agents can assemble components. What they need help preserving is the product
surface behind those components: hierarchy, density, restraint, behavior, copy,
accessibility, trust, and flow. Ghost keeps that surface composition in a
portable `.ghost/fingerprint/` package that ordinary Git review can approve.

## The Shape

The canonical package is intentionally small:

```text
.ghost/
  config.yml                    # optional local routing, not portable context
  fingerprint/
    manifest.yml                # ghost.fingerprint-package/v1 anchor
    prose.yml                   # surface intent
    inventory.yml               # curated material and exemplars
    composition.yml             # patterns, flows, states, and arrangements
    enforcement/checks.yml      # optional deterministic gates
    memory/intent.md            # optional human-approved intent
    memory/decisions/           # optional rationale history
    sources/cache/              # optional generated observations
```

Generation uses the three core layers:

- `prose.yml` says what the surface is trying to do and for whom.
- `inventory.yml` points agents at materials they can inspect or reuse.
- `composition.yml` captures the patterns that make those materials feel like
  one intentional product.

Checks, memory, generated cache, nested packages, and custom `--memory-dir`
locations are supporting features. They do not replace the core fingerprint
layers. Generated cache answers what exists; curated fingerprint layers answer
what the surface is trying to preserve.

Older `resources.yml`, `map.md`, `survey.json`, `patterns.yml`, and direct
`fingerprint.yml` artifacts can still inform migration or cache workflows, but
new Ghost work should target `.ghost/fingerprint/`.

## Project Status: Beta

> [!WARNING]
> Ghost is pre-1.0 and under active development. The CLI, fingerprint schema,
> on-disk `.ghost/fingerprint/` package shape, and public JavaScript exports may
> change in breaking ways before a stable 1.0 release.
>
> Breaking changes may ship in minor versions while Ghost is pre-1.0. Patch
> versions are reserved for fixes that should not require migration. If you adopt
> Ghost today, expect some churn, pin the version you depend on, and review
> release notes before upgrading.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @anarchitecture/ghost
npx ghost --help
npx ghost --help --all
```

`ghost --help` shows the core workflow. `ghost --help --all` shows the complete
command index, and each command supports `ghost <command> --help`.

Install the BYOA skill bundle so Codex, Claude, Cursor, Goose, or another host
agent knows how to author and use the fingerprint:

```bash
npx ghost skill install
# or choose an explicit destination
npx ghost skill install --dest ~/.codex/skills/ghost
```

Then ask your agent in plain English:

```text
Set up the Ghost fingerprint for this repo.
Brief this work from the Ghost fingerprint.
Review this PR against the Ghost fingerprint.
Compare these two Ghost bundles.
```

## Author A Fingerprint

Ghost authoring is a human-plus-agent workflow. The CLI creates, inspects, and
validates the package; the host agent interviews, reads the repo, drafts layer
edits, and asks you to curate the claims.

```bash
ghost init
ghost scan --format json
mkdir -p .ghost/fingerprint/sources/cache
ghost inventory > .ghost/fingerprint/sources/cache/inventory.json
ghost lint .ghost
ghost verify .ghost --root .
```

Use `--with-intent`, `--with-config`, `--reference`, `--scope`, or
`--memory-dir` only when the repo needs those optional files, reference
libraries, nested product areas, or host-wrapper storage paths.

Drafted fingerprint edits are just ordinary file changes until Git review
accepts them. Checked-in `fingerprint/` core files are the Ghost source of
truth.

## Generate From Ghost

Before generating or revising UI, emit the context bundle:

```bash
ghost emit context-bundle
```

The bundle gives a host agent the selected prose, inventory, composition,
optional memory, and active checks. The important shift is timing: Ghost gives
agents surface-composition context before they build, not only after a review
finds drift.

After implementation, run the deterministic and advisory workflows against the
same fingerprint:

```bash
ghost check --base main
ghost review --base main --include-memory
```

`ghost check` runs active `ghost.checks/v1` gates and can fail. `ghost review`
emits an evidence-routed advisory packet for a human or host adapter to use.

## Compare And Govern

Advanced workflows remain available when a repo needs package stacks,
comparison, or explicit drift stance:

```bash
ghost stack apps/checkout/review/page.tsx
ghost compare market/.ghost dashboard/.ghost
ghost ack --stance aligned --reason "Initial baseline"
ghost track new-tracked.fingerprint.md
ghost diverge typography --reason "Editorial product uses a different type scale"
ghost emit review-command --path apps/checkout/review/page.tsx
```

`ghost scan --format json` emits deterministic readiness state. A fingerprint is
`fingerprint-ready` only when prose, inventory, and composition all contain
useful layer content. It does not call an LLM.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ghost init` | Create `.ghost/fingerprint/` package layers. |
| `ghost scan` | Report fingerprint layer readiness for prose, inventory, and composition. |
| `ghost lint` | Validate a fingerprint package or individual artifact. |
| `ghost verify` | Validate evidence paths, exemplar paths, typed check refs, and optional rationale files. |
| `ghost check` | Run active deterministic gates against a diff. |
| `ghost review` | Emit an evidence-routed advisory packet from fingerprint layers and a diff. |
| `ghost emit <kind>` | Emit `review-command` or `context-bundle` artifacts. |
| `ghost skill install` | Install the unified Ghost skill bundle. |
| `ghost stack` | Inspect resolved root-to-leaf fingerprint stacks. |
| `ghost inventory` | Emit raw repo signals as JSON for optional cache material. |
| `ghost describe` | Print optional intent or markdown section ranges. |
| `ghost compare` | Compare fingerprint packages. |
| `ghost ack` / `track` / `diverge` | Record stance toward tracked drift. |
| `ghost diff` / `survey` | Maintain direct markdown fingerprints or survey/cache files for compatibility workflows. |

## Repo Layout

Ghost is a pnpm monorepo. The public package is self-contained for npm; private
workspace packages remain development context.

| Path | Role | Published? |
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| [`packages/ghost`](./packages/ghost) | Public package. Ships the `ghost` CLI, fingerprint package helpers, deterministic checks, advisory review packets, comparison/stance helpers, and the unified skill bundle. | yes: `@anarchitecture/ghost` |
| [`packages/ghost-core`](./packages/ghost-core) | Private historical shared library. Runtime code needed for npm is folded into `packages/ghost`. | no |
| [`packages/ghost-fleet`](./packages/ghost-fleet) | Private fleet view across many Ghost bundles. | no |
| [`packages/ghost-ui`](./packages/ghost-ui) | Reference design system: shadcn registry plus `ghost-mcp` MCP server. | no |
| [`apps/docs`](./apps/docs) | Docs site. | no |

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm check
pnpm dump:cli-help
pnpm --filter @anarchitecture/ghost pack
```

No API key is required to run Ghost. `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `VOYAGE_API_KEY` are
optional and only used by semantic embedding helpers when a host opts in.
