# Ghost

**Ghost is your brand, packed for agents.** A `.ghost/` folder of plain-prose
truths — your stance, your voice, your trust moves — checked into the repo and
read by any agent before it makes anything: a screen, an email, an empty
state, a sentence.

```text
.ghost/
  glossary.md           # your vocabulary
  principle.trust.md    # "near the moment of payment, reduce felt risk…"
  voice.md              # how the brand talks
  asset.logo.md         # points at the actual SVGs
```

Today those decisions live in reviewers' heads — "that's not our voice," again,
on every surface. The agent that built the thing never saw them. Ghost writes
them down once, where the agent looks first.

One portable packet; Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Goose all read the same
one. One package, `@design-intelligence/ghost`. One CLI, `ghost`.

## Thesis

Agents changed the unit of design work. When they make the screens, the
emails, and the sentences, polishing any one of them moves nothing; the next
generation starts from the model's average again. The work that compounds is
architectural: decide where that average serves, decide where the brand must
win, and put those decisions where the agent reads before it makes.

Ghost is that artifact: a fingerprint checked into the repo, carrying the
truths, the materials they point at, and the conditions they hold under.
Buttons stay buttons. The moments that carry your brand get your stance
instead of the default. The few author it once. Every agent it travels to
builds from it.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @design-intelligence/ghost
npx ghost skill install
```

Every `ghost` command is also available as `ghost-fingerprint` when another tool
on your machine owns the `ghost` bin.

## Use It

Ghost is **bring-your-own-agent**. Install the skill bundle so Claude Code,
Codex, Cursor, Goose, or another host agent knows how to author and use the
fingerprint, then ask in plain English:

```text
Set up the Ghost fingerprint for this repo.
Write down the decision I keep repeating about checkout.
Brief this work from the Ghost fingerprint.
Review this diff against the Ghost checks.
```

The CLI does deterministic work. The agent does interpretation.

## The Loop

```bash
ghost init          # scaffold .ghost/ with the steering starter (fingerprint only)
ghost checks init   # opt in to review assertions
ghost validate      # check package shape, nodes, materials, and checks
ghost gather <ask>  # before building: list every node for this task
ghost pull <ids>    # read the picked truths' full bodies
ghost review        # during review: assemble a diff + matched nodes + checks packet
ghost export        # package the fingerprint as a portable artifact with a locator audit
ghost pulse         # while tuning: summarize local gather/pull events
```

`gather` and `pull` append structured JSONL events to `.ghost/.events`, a gitignored events tape. That's for tuning descriptions and seeing what agents reached
for. The events tape is local tuning signal, not canonical fingerprint state.

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ghost init` | Scaffold `.ghost/` with the steering starter: manifest, glossary, `index.md`, and demo nodes for stance, composition, anti-goals, patterns, exemplars, materials, and decisions. `--template minimal` writes only the small manifest/glossary/index starter. `--with checks` also adds the checks directory. |
| `ghost checks init` | Scaffold `.ghost/checks/` with an example review assertion. |
| `ghost validate` | Validate the package: manifest, node validity, material locators, check references, and glossary kind prefixes. |
| `ghost gather [ask…]` | Emit the fingerprint menu for the agent to select from; log the exposed ids. Wild-posture kinds are excluded by default; `--wild` opts in. |
| `ghost pull <id> [<id>…]` | Emit selected node bodies and material locators; log selected and missed ids. |
| `ghost review` | Emit an advisory review packet from a diff, matched material-backed nodes, and checks (requires `.ghost/checks/`). |
| `ghost export` | Package the fingerprint as a portable artifact with a locator audit. |
| `ghost pulse` | Summarize local gather/pull events: abandoned gathers, hit rates, cold nodes, and misses. |
| `ghost skill install` | Install the skill bundle for your host agent. |
| `ghost manifest` | Emit a self-describing JSON manifest of commands and flags _(advanced)_. |

Run `ghost --help` for the core workflow, `ghost --help --all` for everything,
and `ghost <command> --help` for flags.

## How It Works

A fingerprint is a small folder of prose. The CLI computes; your agent reads,
writes, and decides.

```text
.ghost/
  manifest.yml          # schema + package id (the anchor)
  glossary.md           # your kind vocabulary + what each kind means
  index.md              # the curated front door
  principle.trust.md    # a brand truth of kind `principle`
  asset.logo.md         # a truth that may point at concrete materials
  checks/               # optional review assertions; never nodes
```

The fingerprint is a **flat set of nodes**. A node is one markdown file: a
`description` in frontmatter, optional `materials`, and a brand truth in the
prose body.

```markdown
---
description: Logo lockups, clearspace, and when the glyph can stand alone.
materials:
  - brand/logo*.svg
  - https://figma.com/file/example?node-id=logo-lockups
---

Use the full lockup when recognition matters. Use the glyph only when space is
constrained or when brand presence should recede.
```

`materials` is one list of locators for the concrete stuff the truth is about:
repo-relative paths/globs or absolute HTTPS URLs. Components, patterns, logos,
motion files, illustrations, and external asset libraries all use the same field.
Guidance stays in prose; `materials` only says where the material is.

**Checks** are optional review assertions in a flat `.ghost/checks/` directory.
Core `ghost init` ships no checks; add them explicitly:

```bash
ghost checks init
```

Checks are not nodes. They are review assertions used by `ghost review`:

```markdown
---
name: logo-clearspace-holds
description: Logo usage preserves clearspace, lockup integrity, and glyph rules.
severity: medium
references:
  - asset.logo
---

Grade whether the change preserves the logo guidance in `asset.logo`.
```

`ghost gather` and `ghost pull` are feed-forward. `ghost review` is feed-back: it
reads a diff, matches touched files to node `materials`, offers relevant checks,
and emits an advisory packet for the host agent to weigh.

Reserved at the package root: `manifest.yml`, `glossary.md`, and `checks/`.
Every other `*.md` is a node. Renaming a node changes its id.

The packet is the product; the CLI is the courier. Everything above —
gather, pull, review, checks, the events tape — is machinery around the
fingerprint, and the fingerprint outlives all of it.

## Portable by Design

The fingerprint travels. It is agent-agnostic (every host agent reads the same
packet), medium-agnostic (the same truths steer a screen, a page, an email, a
sentence), and repo-native (it moves with a clone, a fork, a new hire's first
checkout). When you need it as a standalone artifact:

```bash
ghost export    # package the fingerprint as a portable brand artifact, with a locator audit
```

The export audits every `materials` locator so the packet doesn't silently
point at things that moved.

## Project Status: Beta

> [!WARNING]
> Ghost is pre-1.0 and under active development. The CLI, fingerprint schema,
> on-disk `.ghost/` package shape, and public JavaScript exports may change in
> breaking ways before a stable 1.0 release.
